# Lower-grade gliomas (LGG) Brain Tumor Segmentation / Survival Risk Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the segmentation of Lower-Grade Gliomas (LGG) brain tumors and the prediction of survival risk using AI-based algorithms. It combines a tumor segmentation model with a classification model that predicts the likelihood of survival, providing an integrated approach to LGG analysis. In this project, we implement a Multi-Input CNN Model to perform segmentation and risk prediction on MR data. UNet is used to segment image first, and features are extracted from the last layer. With the extracted features, image data, and genomic data are then combined to perform binary classification (risk percentage prediction)

## Project Results
AI-based LGG Brain Tumor Segmentation and Survival Risk Prediction Algorithm: An algorithm that combines tumor segmentation and binary classification to predict survival risk.
